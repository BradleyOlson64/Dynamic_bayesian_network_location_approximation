# Dynamic_bayesian_network_location_approximation
This body of code was designed to allow a computer to play a minigame inspired by pacman. In the game pacman is trying to catch a ghost, but pacman doesn't have a clear idea of where the ghost is. The game is played on a 10 x 10 grid of squares with both pacman and the ghost moving from their current square to one with an adjacent face or staying in the same place each turn. Pacman only has an estimate of the manhattan distance between him and the ghost at each time frame. To allow pacman to eficiently catch the ghost I created a dynamic bayesian network and enacted the forward algorithm as well as particle filtering to estimate the state (location of the ghost) at each time frame. Moving pacman towards the most likely ghost position as estimated by partical filtering and the forward algorithm allowed pacman to find his quarry. The code comes with a graphical interface showing the progression of pacman and the ghost around the grid of play as well as well as pacman's belief of where the ghost is for any given time slice.
